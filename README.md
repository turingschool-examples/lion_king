As you work through this example, follow these rules:

* Every time a method is called, create a stack frame for that method on an index card
* After you make the stack frame, place a sticky note on the current frame on the stack for the return value.
* Put the new stack frame on the stack
* On the stack frame, put any local variables that are defined on this stack frame
* When that stack frame finishes executing, write its return value on the top sticky note
